Team:

## Design

## Shoes microservice

The apprach was to complete the back end api points then move onto the front end.
The Shoes microservice polls the bins from the wardrobe monolith.

## Hats microservice


For this project I started by creating Models for the hats entity then one for a LocationVo to use in polling and accessing the wardrobe microservice. I used the import_href as a unique id to interact with the wordrobe microservice.
